# aelf Bounties

 This repository is used to post issues, bounties, and hackathons on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/aelfproject).

这个bounty库可以放aelf所有的bounty。由于现在bounty只发布在Gitcoin上因此这里只放了这里的首页链接，如果之后合作了其他平台会随时更新。

## Rules

 \- Join our [Telegram Developer Community](https://t.me/aelfdeveloper) before you start working, our tech team is there to help you.

 \- You should only submit your original work, the code of which should be open-source and available on GitHub.

 \- Your submissions should include a demo of your work, either video or text depending on the specific bounty requirement, that explains its functionalities.

 \- For contest bounties, we encourage as many developers as possible to apply and will pay out to the best submission.

 \- A submission needs to be evaluated as qualified to receive prizes. Hence, we reserve the right to withhold payment in the event that none of the submissions meet the standards.
